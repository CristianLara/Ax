## Outline
Goals:
- Understand early stopping as a key vehicle for resource saving
- Introduce most common early stopping algorithms in Ax
- Explain how early stopping can be used in conjunction with BO

Contents:
- Explain where timeseries data may appear in typical BO settings, like learning curves
- Show how killing bad trials early can allow us to save resources OR run more trials using the same amount of resources
- Introduce most common early stopping algorithms in Ax
- Explain how the partial data can be fed back into surrogate models to improve BO
## Prerequisites
Introduction to Bayesian Optimization
